Anyone know what this is?

A map of the Internet
(that someone made up)

At the end of every branch is a cluster of servers, and each of those servers hosts files.

Did you know there are 17,883,409,372,001 web pages on the World Wide Web?

I bet you didn't, because I just made it up.

It's impossible to measure the size of the interwebs.

Every second Twitter gets 600 new tweets

Point = The WWW is ginormous!

Yeah, lots of it is garbage

But there's still a ton of interesting stuff out there.  So how do you access it programmatically?

Let's start with the majority of the pages out there: XML-based data


It's easy enough to download it.  But how do you parse it?

Regular Expressions?

Who here likes regexes? First one to tell me what this does gets a t-shirt

So we need a structured data source, one accessible via an API (Applcation Programming Interface)

Companies have discovered that if you build APIs, developers will come

And it saves your from having to dance around on stage like a monkey

(search: "Monkey dance")

APIs are awesome. You get (mostly) whatever data in (mostly) whatever format you want and in a (mostly) easy to parse structure.

Yahoo!, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft, ... Most popular web services offer them now days.

As neat as they are, they are imperfect.  You have to read how to use them

Forget what you were told as a kid, reading sucks

We're developers, we're lazy and we want to build stuff!

Mashups are really cool, but they can sometimes become a convoluted mess.

Yahoo invented a solution to this problem...
YQL (stupid crazy intro)

"The Yahoo! Query Language is an expressive SQL-like language that lets you query, filter, and join data across Web services. With YQL, apps run faster with fewer lines of code and a smaller network footprint."

You now have a common way of accessing any data on the web, with or without APIs, and all in one common syntax that you are likely familiar with.




Pizza = original mashup
