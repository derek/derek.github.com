        <h1>What is this talk about?</h1>
        <!--
        
            So what is this talk about?
             
            It's a bit more philosophical than most of the talks you'll see here at YUIConf.
            I was originally going to give a talk on porting applications from other libraries
            to YUI, but I felt that was missing the story of why you would want to do 
            that in the first place.
            
            So as I talked to other developers on the YUI team and within the community 
            about their favorite parts of the library, 
            and why it is they used YUI, 
            I began to see some patterns emerge.  
            
            So this talk is a reflection of those conversations. 
            
            In short, it's a talk about what makes YUI the most 
            uniquely ideal toolkit to build high-scale, maintainable JavaScript applications.

        <h1>Modularity</h1>
        
        <!--
        
            Modules are a concept used across many engineering disciplines.  
            In a space station sense, they refer to the 32 separately constructed components it is made up of.
            
            In a software sense, they similarly refer to bits of focused, 
            interchangeable components that you can use to construct 
            whatever application you are tasked with building.
            
            You'll find native module support in many programming languages.  
            Ruby, Java, Python.  
            
            But unfortunately not in JavaScript. 
            Why? Well, JavaScript was developed over the course of a few weeks.  
            I don't think that was a consideration at the time.
            
            But, to everyone's surprise, JS has exceeded expectations 
            and it is now an extremely popular programming language.
            
            The need for them is here, so it's been left up to developers to design their own module patterns.
            
            So let's take a look at one of those.

            Modules are a fundamental building block for everything you do in YUI.  
            Between the Core library and the YUI Gallery, 
            you'll see over 600 modules that you can use inside of your application 
            to do everything from 
            DOM manipulation,
            animation, 
            object-oriented helpers, 
            and many more.

            It isn't intended that you use all of them at the same time, 
            but rather to pick and chose only the ones you want.

        <!-- 
            YUI is one of the few popular JavaScript libraries that uses this modular architecture, 
            but we're seeing greater adoption from other libraries.  
            We're even starting to see standards emerge, such as AMD and CommonJS.
            
            Dojo is has recently adopted the AMD pattern, 
            and Node.js has popularized CommonJS Modules/1.1.
            
            We're really happy with YUI Modules so far, but that's not to say we haven't begun 
            exploring additional support for other formats.
            
            If you are curious about the work being done there, 
            check out the YUI forum for discussion about this topic.
            As always, we're very interested in hearing your feedback.
            
            The eventual goal is to have native module support in JavaScript, 
            which is coming, but it's still in the proposal phase. So we'll see.

            When working within a library, it's extremely important that you consider

            Extensibility is important, because in web development, there is one constant, change.  
            
            This is because new ideas, 
            technologies, libraries, and standards, 
            are all evolving at an accelerated pace.
            
            Years ago, when I was at a startup, my manager came to me and said,
            "hey, we need a rich text editor for that form."
            
            We were using jQuery at the time, so I searched for "jquery rich text editor plugin." 
             
            I came across a bunch of plugins, clicked around, checked out the demos,
            and figured out which one fit my requirements.  

            Pasted it in, glue it together. Done.
            
            2 weeks later, "Oh, users need the ability to upload and add pictures in that editor."
            I now had a feature I needed to add to the editor, which it was never meant to support.
            I cracked open the plugin, starting hacking away, and eventually I got to work.
            
            The problem is, I can never update that plugin without losing my modifications.
            
            The point of this is...

            Every component within YUI is developed with extensibility in mind.

            YUI is called a library, but I personally view it more as a toolkit.  
            That's not saying the "library" term is incorrect.  
            The terms Library, toolkit, and framework are often used interchangeably, 
            so I don't want to get lost in semantics.  
            
            The reason I say 'toolkit' most accurately describes YUI is because it allows 
            you to pick & choose just what you need, and nothing more.  
            
            And you can use much of it independent of each other.

        <h2>Loading modules</h2>

        <!-- 
        
            Let's take a look at a pretty typical page that is using a modular, 
            or a psuedo-modular method of organizing code.
            
            You have the core library which you need to load in first, 
            then you start including your modules one by one.
            
            So, there are a number of issues here when you consider performance.
            
            First of all, you are blocking rendering because you stuffed all your JavaScript into the head element.
            Next, you have a very fragile load order.  
            What if you include any of your modules before coreLibrary.js? 
            What if moduleB requires moduleA to run?

            Also, do you load all 27 modules you have on every page? 
            Load them selectively? 
            How do you handle dependency resolution? 
            Dependency calculation?
            What about CSS dependencies for UI widgets?
            
            These were just some of the issues that immediately popped in my head.  
            I'm sure there are plenty more.
            
            So as you can guess, these are all issues Loader takes care of for you.

            So we've looked at Loader,

            Now, one of the problems you may run into if you have 50 modules 
            to load on your page, you are doing 50 HTTP requests. 
            
            So as you can imagine, YUI has a solution for that.
        
            For those of you that don't recognize this, it's a bento box.
            You'll find these in Japan sold at convenience stores, train stations, and bento shops.
            
            It's basically a packaged mixture of various types of food 
            for a quick, convenient meal, and not much more.
            
            That pretty accurately describes what YUI's combo-loading service does. 
            The idea is to combine everything you need into a single, optimized HTTP request.

        Sandboxes are a broadly used term in JavaScript.  Sometimes they are in reference to 
        Sandboxes sound scary at first, but they're really very, very simple.  
        The idea is that you control what instance of YUI you use, regardless of how deeply nested you are.

<div class="slide">
    <h2>Sandboxes</h2>

    <pre><code class="prettyprint">YUI().use('yql', function(Y){

Y.log(typeof Y.YQL); // function

Y.use(function(X){
    Y.log(typeof X.YQL); // function
});

YUI().use(function(Y){
    Y.log(typeof Y.YQL); // undefined
